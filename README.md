# esp-socket-server
A multithreaded server that can communicate between a client and any number of esps in varying configurations.

This will not work out of the box. You need to have the server code running on a chosen device, you must upload the esp code to the esp, and you must make sure to add the ip and wifi identification to the files that require it.
